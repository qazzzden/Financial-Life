Text/49/text,"""Ah, morning... The finance lecture starts in an hour. I must hurry up, please just don’t interrupt me this time"""
Text/4a/text,"Maya gets out of bed carefully, trying not to wake her roommates."
Text/4b/text,"""My room is always neat and clean. Let’s keep it this way."""
Text/4c/text,"Maya approaches her desk, turns on her laptop, and tries to connect to Wi-Fi, but with no success."
Text/4d/text,"""Wi-Fi problems again... Why is it always like this? Well, never mind, I have a book version for this."""
Text/4e/text,"Maya takes the book out of her backpack and opens it, preparing for the lecture."
Text/4f/text,"""Oh my God, yesterday . . . so much fun! I'm so tired. . ."""
Text/50/text,"""Yeah, me too... These weekends never end. . . call her?"""
Text/51/text,Maya swallows her irritation and focuses on reading.
Text/52/text,"Maya exits her room, closing the door."
Text/53/text,"Come on, Maya, you can handle this. Concentrate on the lecture and let’s push financial problems away for now at least."
Text/54/text,". . . Remember, financial literacy is a lifelong process, and the more you educate yourself, the better equipped you'll be to make informed financial decisions."
Text/55/text,"Thank you all for attending, and have a great day!"
Text/56/text,"""Oh, that lecture was intense. Finance is not the easiest topic."""
Text/57/text,"Hey, Maya! How are you doing, how was the lecture?"
Text/58/text,"Hey, Emily. Well, I’m good, lecture wasn't easy, but I tried to grasp all the important points."
Text/59/text,"I know finance can be challenging. By the way, I have this super helpful app that might assist you. It's called Financial Life."
Text/5a/text,Maya looks at Emily with some skepticism.
Text/5b/text,Financial Life? Sounds like a stock trading program. I'm not sure if you want to help me or bury even deeper.
Text/5c/text,"No, no, it's not about trading ha-ha. Financial Life is an app designed to assist in financial situations."
Text/5d/text,"It provides useful advice and helps with budget planning. It really helped me, believe me."
Text/5e/text,Maya is still cautiously thinking about this app but decides to give it a chance.
Text/5f/text,"Alright, I'll give it a try. At least to see what it offers."
Text/60/text,"Great! I'm sure you'll like it. Go ahead, download it, and see what advice it provides."
Text/61/text,"Suddenly, Maya remembers urgent tasks she has to do."
Text/62/text,"Oops, sorry, Emily, I have some urgent matters to attend to. I need to leave immediately. But thanks for the recommendation, I'll definitely check the app."
Text/63/text,"No problem, Maya. Good luck with your tasks! Be sure to let me know about your experience with Financial Life"
Text/64/text,Maya waves goodbye and hurries off.
Text/65/text,"""Financial Life... Maybe it can help me heh."""
